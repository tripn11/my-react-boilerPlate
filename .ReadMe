the .env.firebase file must be updated with the current values of the database created.
had to download corejs and import at appjs to replace babel polyfills though its deprecated
adviced to add npm i --save-dev @types/core-js for the core-js declaration
installed old versions of firebase and react-dates since the latest ones refused to install
the conditionals for webpack configuration are not really working well, in production mode, it isn't splitting the css into a new file.
Alternatively i could create a seperate config file for dev and for prod or use webpack merge tool to create them after creating a webpack.common.js file
